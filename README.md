# mortimer.nl website

My personal website, build with Zola, the Rust static site generator.

Pulled the theme from simple-dev-blog-zola-starter and reworked that.

## Installation

```sh
brew install zola # I used this
# cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/getzola/zola # Didn't build from source.
```

## Build locally

```sh
zola serve
```

Then open your browser at `http://localhost:1111`
